In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header.

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer:** The more training points we add, the more our model learns and depending on the selected hyperparameter(max_depth), we can see how this affects the model's score. If the score will decrease too much we can not go with such a model, if it stays closer to 1 it good for the model and at some point we can see the trend of the curve. After that, there is no point to add more training points. From the examples above we should choose the model with the parameters max_depth = [3, 6, 10]. After that, we do the same process for the testing curve. We can see that at some moment the testing curve becomes be parallel (or even slightly touch the training curve for the max_depth = 3) and there is no point to add more training points. We already can see the trend. So, the max_depth  between 3 and 6 should be the best for us. "

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer:** The model trained with the maximum depth of 1 suffers from high bias(underfitting). The training score and validation score aligned to each other, but the scores are very low, which means that the model useless for predictions, we will have the mean value of the price all the time on the prediction step. The model trained with a maximum depth of 10 suffers from high variance(overfitting). We see that it has a very high score on the training set, but fails on the validation set, which means the model can not generalize and just memorized training set."

At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

    "**Answer:** Grid search is a model hyperparameter optimization technique. In scikit-learn this technique is provided in the `GridSearchCV` class. When constructing this class you must provide a dictionary of hyperparameters to evaluate in the `param_grid` argument. This is a map of the model parameter name and an array of values to try. The `GridSearchCV` process will then construct and evaluate one model for each combination of parameters. Cross validation is used to evaluate each individual model and the default of 3-fold cross validation is used. Once completed, you can access the outcome of the grid search in the result object returned from `grid.fit()`. The `best_score_` member provides access to the best score observed during the optimization procedure and the `best_params_` describes the combination of parameters that achieved the best results. Hyper-parameters are parameters that are not directly learnt within estimators. In scikit-learn they are passed as arguments to the constructor of the estimator classes. Typical examples include C, kernel and gamma for Support Vector Classifier, alpha for Lasso, etc. "

    "**Answer:** [Cross-Validation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4G__SV580CxFj78o9yUXuQ.png) is very similar to train/test split, but it’s applied to more subsets. Meaning, we split our data into k subsets, and train on k-1 one of those subset. What we do is to hold the last subset for test. We’re able to do it for each of the subsets. In [K-Folds Cross Validation](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*J2B_bcbd1-s1kpWOu_FZrg.png) we split our data into k different subsets (or folds). We use k-1 subsets to train our data and leave the last subset (or the last fold) as test data. We then average the model against each of the folds and then finalize our model. After that we test it against the test set. It is possible and recommended to search the hyper-parameter space for the best cross validation score. The Grid Search algorithm can be very slow, owing to the potentially huge number of combinations to test. Furthermore, cross validation further increases the execution time and complexity."

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

But in my opinion the inflation should not be an issue, we can multiply the result which the model produces with the inflation ratio. I do not see any problems if we train the model based on old futures values and try make the prediction for the current market using the inflation ration. For sure our model will be more interesting and precise if we will consider other factors like quality of appliances in the home, square feet of the plot area and etc. We have to remember about overfitting in such case. In general, I think it will be better to separate the data collected for an urban and rural city. Because something which could affect the price in the city very significantly could do not make any sense in a rural city. Or even have the opposite tendency. I guess that is fair enough to judge the price on an individual home based on the characteristics of the entire neighborhood in most cases. For sure there are some exceptions. For example, It could be the home when lived famous writer and should be considered as a museum."
